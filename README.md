# Game

## What is this program and who can use it?

This project is a simple game created using Pygame, which is a library of code that allows you to create simple games using Python programming. This game is suitable for younger children between the ages of 5 to 12 years as it would be way too simple for teenagers to play.

## Describing the program

The game consists of 1 *player* object, 3 *enemy* objects and 1 *prize* object. When the user runs the program (starts the game), the player object appears on the left hand side of the screen and is stationary. The enemy and prize objects approach the player object from different positions on the right hand side of the screen. The user must move the player object using the right, left, up and down keys in order to avoid the enemy objects and 'collect' the prize object. The concept of the game is simple. If the player object collides with an enemy object, the user loses and the game is over. If the player object collides with the prize object, the user wins and the game is over. If the player object does not collide with any enemy or prize object, the user loses because they did not collect the prize and the game ends.
